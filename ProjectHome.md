MogreGis3D is software written in C# that enables you to visualize, query, and manipulate GIS data from within an 3D application. In short, you can generate spatially accurate 3D geometry from GIS data layers while maintaining connectivity to the GIS data sources.

This project is a port of osgGis to C#. It uses Mogre for 3D visualization.
